  <dt><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></dt>
  <dd>A branch of computer science which aims to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving capabilities in machines.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong></dt>
  <dd>A subfield of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms that learn from patterns in data to make predictions without being explicitly programmed. There are 4 basic types of machine learning:

  - supervised learning - uses labeled datasets;
   
  - unsupervised learning - uses unlabeled datasets;
  
  - semi-supervised learning - uses both labeled and unlabeled datasets;
  
  - reinforcement learning - mimics the trial-and-error learning process in humans.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Neural Network (NN)</strong></dt>
  <dd>A group of interconnected artificial neurons that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the neurons in the human brain.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Deep Learning (DL)</strong></dt>
  <dd>A branch of machine learning that uses multiple layers of neural networks to learn from data.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Generative AI (GenAi)</strong><dt>
  <dd>A subset of AI capable of creating new content (text, images, audio, videos etc.) that resembles real-world data.</dd>
