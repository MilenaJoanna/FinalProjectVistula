- **efficiency** - thanks to LLM-s tasks can be automated, thus reducing the manual human effort.
- **scalability** - LLM-s can be scaled to handle large amounts of data.
- **flexibility** - LLMs-s can be adjusted to specific use cases and needs.  
- **improved user experience** - LLM-s can increase user's satisfaction, for example by providing more context-aware responses.

- **content research and information retrieval** - LLM can filter vast amounts of data to extract relevant information.
- **coding** - LLM-s can produce code snippets or provide explanations for programming concepts.
- **language translation and localization** - LLM-s can provide accurate and context-aware translations between languages, comparable with major Neural Machine Translation systems for wide-spoken languages. 
- **sentiment analysis** - LLM-s can recognize whether the data (for example customers' reviews) are positive, negative, or neutral.
- **conversational AI and chatbots** - LLM-s can answer questions and hold natural, human-like text conversations with users which can be used for customer service, technical support, or personal assistance.
