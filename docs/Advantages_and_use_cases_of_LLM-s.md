# Advantages and use cases of LLMs


<p style= "padding: 35px 25px 5px;">LLMs have many advantages like:</p>

- **efficiency** - thanks to LLMs tasks can be automated, thus reducing the manual human effort.
- **scalability** - LLMs can be scaled to handle large amounts of data.
- **flexibility** - LLMs-s can be adjusted to specific use cases and needs.  
- **improved user experience** - LLMs can increase user's satisfaction, for example by providing more context-aware responses.

<p style= "padding: 35px 25px 5px;">Large language models may be used for many purposes, by individuals as well as enterprises. The most common applications are:</p>

- **content generation** - LLMs can create human-like text: product descriptions, blog posts, news articles, poems, scripts and many more.
- **context rephrasing** - LLMs can rephrase text according to provided rules or examples, while preserving its original meaning.
  
  A good example of a practical usage is the AI Positron Assistant in Oxygen XML Editor. It'a tool that can be used for proofreading, it catches grammar and spelling mistakes and gives suggestions to improve sentence structure and style.

- **content summarization** - LLMs can summarize lengthy texts and extract the most important pieces of information.
- **content research and information retrieval** - LLM can filter vast amounts of data to extract relevant information.
- **coding** - LLMs can produce code snippets or provide explanations for programming concepts.
- **language translation and localization** - LLMs can provide accurate and context-aware translations between languages, comparable with major Neural Machine Translation systems for wide-spoken languages. 
  
  A good example of such large language model is NLLB-200 introduced by Meta AI. It translates across 200 different languages, also those that were previously unsupported by existing translation tools. It's worth noting that the model includes support for 55 African languages.

- **sentiment analysis** - LLMs can recognize whether the data (for example customers' reviews) are positive, negative, or neutral.
  
  A representative example is a tone detector feature in the grammar and spell checking app Grammarly. It analyzes the text for sentiment and emotional cues, categorizing the tone into various labels such as disheartening, curious, formal, accusatory, disapproving, assertive, joyful, or optimistic and others. It helps understand how the written message might be perceived by the reader and allows to adjust the tone accordingly.

- **conversational AI and chatbots** - LLMs can answer questions and hold natural, human-like text conversations with users which can be used for customer service, technical support, or personal assistance. 
- **classification and categorization** - LLMs excel at classifying and categorizing content based on predefined criteria. They can be used for categorizing customer support tickets, emails, documentation, or other written materials.
  
  As an example we can take here the Cohere Classify app that identifies and filters out hate speech, abusive language, spam, and profanity.

- **personal recommendations** - LLM-based recommendation systems offer users personalized suggestions based on the users' previous preferences and behavior.

 <p style= "padding: 35px 25px 5px;"> LLMs certainly already offer many opportunities, and, with the passage of time, and development of AI, these opportunities will probably become even more spectacular. </p>
